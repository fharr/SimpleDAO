# Unity Example

This example provides you a simple but concrete use case of SimpleDAO.

## Preparation

You only need to publish the database to run the example. To do so, double click on the publish profile you will find under:

		UnityExample.Database > Publish > UnityExample.Database.publish.xml
		
Then click on publish. This will create a new database called Unity.Database into your (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB sql server instance.

## Start

Now you can run the program.
